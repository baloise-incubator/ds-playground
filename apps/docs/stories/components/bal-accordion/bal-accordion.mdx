<Lead>**Accordions** put users in control of showing or hiding content. Accordions also help us organize information to
  keep screens less cluttered so that users can accomplish tasks in short, intuitive steps. And accordions can help
  users find content they need. The component can be used standalone, in combination or inside [BalCard](?path=/docs/components-containment-card--documentation).</Lead>
<br />
The accordion is build on 3 child components:

- `bal-accordion-summary` defines the visible header of the accordion and can also act as a trigger.
- `bal-accordion-trigger` shows and hides the details of the accordion.
- `bal-accordion-details` is the content to be hidden by default.

<StoryHeading of={AccordionStories.OldVersion}></StoryHeading>

The old version adhered to the previous style guide. It became evident that a more flexible solution
was necessary, leading to a restructuring of the accordion.
While the old version remains available, it is strongly recommended to use the updated version above.
