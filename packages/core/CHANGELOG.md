## 15.1.0

### Minor Changes

- **forms**: Introduce a new property `auto-invalid-off` to exclude a form control in Angular reactive forms from being visibly set as invalid. ([#1271](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1271))

### Patch Changes

- **a11y**: The term `hidden` is a reserved accessibility (a11y) value. Consequently, we found it necessary to rename our hidden properties for checkboxes, radio buttons, tabs, and steps. ([#1266](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1266))
  The attribute remains in place for now, ensuring no breaking changes at this time.

  The `hidden` property for the checkbox and radio has been updated and renamed to `non-submit.`
  The `hidden` property for the tabs and steps has been updated and renamed to `invisible.`

- **radio-group & checkbox-group**: component now updates its children when there are changes in the disabled or invalid status. ([#1264](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1264) )
- **field**: in horizontal layout now lacks right padding, and the label is aligned to the right. ([#1260](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1260))
- **carousel**: corrected the z-index value for sticky controls. ([#1265](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1265))
- **nav**: now provides enhanced support for colored service cards on mobile resolutions. ([#1261](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1261) )
- **carousel**: has vertical scrolling with tab controls on mobile devices. ([#1269](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1269))
- **angular**: `bal-ng-error` is now more synchronized with Angular lifecycles, ensuring improved visibility and hiding of validation messages. ([#1263](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1263))
- **brand-icons**: Merges styles from `<style>` elements to the style attribute of matching elements. ([#1262](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1262))

- **nav**: Add missing `âžž` sign to the overview links in the `bal-nav` component and adjust padding and height of the `bal-popup` component in fullscreen variant. ([#1242](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1242))
- **carousel**: Reduce padding tab buttons to allow longer labels. ([#1239](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1239))

## 15.0.0

### Major Changes

- **styles**: Removed the deprecated option of component styles with SASS. Instead, for customizing the component design, use CSS Variables. ([#1127](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1127))
- **angular**: The option to `applyPolyfills` for outdated browsers such as IE11 and legacy Edge has been deprecated, as the current design system no longer provides support for these versions. ([#1127](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1127))
- **angular**: Now by default the Baloise Design System will mark a form control as invalid when it's been touched and is indeed invalid. ([#1127](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1127))
  To disable this feature, set setInvalid to false in the design system configuration.

  ```ts
  BaloiseDesignSystemModule.forRoot({
    defaults: { ... },
    forms: {
      setInvalid: false, // to deactivate it
    },
  })
  ```

### Minor Changes

- **components** are now available as standalone elements for Angular v17. [#1127](https://github.com/baloise/design-system/pull/1127)

  Use the `provideBaloiseDesignSystem` provider within the app.config.ts file, where Angular providers are typically defined.

  **app.config.ts**

  ```ts
  import { ApplicationConfig, importProvidersFrom } from "@angular/core";

  import { provideBaloiseDesignSystem } from "@baloise/design-system-components-angular/standalone";

  export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [provideBaloiseDesignSystem()],
  };
  ```

  In each app component, import the necessary Baloise Design System components or a bundled set.

  **app.component.ts**

  ```ts
  import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA, Component } from "@angular/core";
  import { CommonModule } from "@angular/common";
  import {
    BalApp,
    BalButton,
  } from "@baloise/design-system-components-angular/standalone";

  export interface UpdateControl {
    name: string;
    value: any;
  }

  @Component({
    selector: "app-root",
    standalone: true,
    schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
    imports: [CommonModule, BalApp, BalButton],
    template: `
      <bal-app>
        <main class="container py-normal">
          <bal-button>My Button</bal-button>
        </main>
      </bal-app>
    `,
  })
  export class AppComponent {}
  ```

#### Webpack builder

For projects based on the builder `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` use the `@baloise/design-system-components-angular/legacy`.
